                        <p class="card-text">PROVIDENCE, RI – Mayor Jorge Elorza today announced that Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded the City of Providence’s outlook to stable from negative. Moody’s also affirmed the City’s Baa1 general obligation rating and Baa2 lease ratings. According to the agency, the upgrade reflects Providence’s improved financial position, manageable fixed costs and growing economy.

“Moody’s upgrade recognizes the progress we’ve made through our commitment to long-term planning and fiscal responsibility,” said Mayor Jorge O. Elorza. “We’re a city on the rise and while this is big news, we must continue to keep a close eye on our finances to keep Providence going strong.”

In its report, Moody’s noted that Providence serves as a regional economic center and pointed to improved budgeting practices and a stabilizing financial position due to multiple years of positive operating performance. The City realized a $5.4 million operating surplus in fiscal year 2017, bringing its Operating Fund balance to $2.3 million. The analysis underscored the elimination of the City’s cumulative deficit three years ahead of its Combined Deficit Reduction Payment Plan schedule. A $3.5 million surplus is expected for fiscal year 2018 for additional growth to reserves.

Other factors considered included pension savings achieved through multiple years of early payments of the city’s ARC; improvement in funding for long-term liabilities; a growing tax base with growing economic development; and decline in unemployment.

In 2016, Fitch Ratings upgraded the City’s outstanding General Obligation (GO) Bonds to ‘A-‘ and assigned a ‘stable’ outlook. Fitch also upgraded Providence’s Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB-‘.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">PROVIDENCE, RI – Mayor Jorge O. Elorza today joined City Council President David A. Salvatore, FabNewport Executive Director Steve Heath, Providence Public Library Executive Director Jack Martin, Providence Community Libraries Youth Services Specialist Jennifer Romans, community members and representatives from Rhode Island Museum of Science and Art and Young Voices to announce the launch of the innovative PVD Young Makers program, which will introduce makerspaces to ten public libraries citywide to expand youth access to advanced digital technologies and creative design tools.

“PVD Young Makers prepares our kids to be the next generation of makers, designers, creatives, and big thinkers in our city,” said Mayor Jorge O. Elorza. “Our children are creative by nature and by supporting their curiosity, we are supporting their futures.”

PVD Young Makers seeks to bolster STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) learning by promoting creativity and positive youth development to better prepare youth for the 21st century global workforce. Youth will be exposed to advanced manufacturing tools that include sewing machines, VR cameras and viewers, vinyl cutters, laser cutters, Dash Robots, and 3D printers.

“Opportunities like PVD Young Makers helps to ensure that Providence remains the ‘Creative Capital’,” said City Council President David A. Salvatore. “These opportunities that merge art, science and technology will prepare our students to not only think broadly and boldly, but will help them be competitive in a changing workforce as they grow older.”

Youth will also earn badges as they become more proficient at using each tool, entitling holders to access, with the support of a PVD Young Maker’s Coach or librarian, that piece of equipment at any library or partner organization.

“Libraries are the perfect platform for launching this endeavor,” said Steve Heath. “They already serve as community hubs, are experienced with digital technologies and excellent at mentoring, connecting, and guiding.”

The City partnered with non-profit FabNewport following a competitive bid process last year. This year, the City has proposed to invest $250,000 to expand access to the PVD Young Makers program. In addition to these funds, FabNewport is leveraging over $400,000, nearly doubling the total amount invested in the program to date.

“Providence Public Library is proud to be a partner on this important citywide initiative to expose our young people to dynamic learning opportunities and empower them with hands-on experiences they will need to succeed in our technology-based world,” said Jack Martin. “We want Providence’s youth and families to know that their libraries are places where they can come to learn and grow, whatever their interests and goals may be.”
